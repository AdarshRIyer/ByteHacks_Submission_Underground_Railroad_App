# ByteHacks_Submission_Underground_Railroad_App
An original and innovative solution to help fleeing contrabands escape from the horrors of slavery. Consists of a user friendly UI with easy to use navigation, login and register pages, a working location finder, and a real-time messaging app that can also act as a group chat. The chat uses Scaledrone as the realtime back end of the program. Overall, the Underground Railroad App is a unique app with a multi faceted way to help all those involved in helping contrabands flee slavery.  Additionally, if it is implemented, it will be kept very secret and out of the knowledge of most people.

Instructions:
Choose your role, and create an account or sign in if you have one. From your homepage, you can navigate anywhere you might need to assist a contraband. Many helping resources are available including maps, messaging, location tracking, warrants, and much much more. At each stage of the program after login, you are allowed to go to the homepage or logout. The app is quite self explanatory, and shows explanatory text to help anybody who is unsure of what to do.

Notes:
The realtime chat part of this app works with any other person anywhere on the internet who has the correct ID code.

The list of what supplies are available, the list of reservations, map for conductor, the certificates, and conductor names are auto generated and not kept in a server. We did not have enough time to look into solutions to these issues and therefore made it as close to the final product as possible - which we believe is quite close given our time limit.

If you register, the program does not keep your information.

To login, use Username: "Username" and password: "password" without the quotes for any type of account

The chat uses a real-time back end of scaledrone, where you can create an account and messaging channel for free.

This project is only meant for submission to ByteHacks 2020, and has been created solely for that purpose.
